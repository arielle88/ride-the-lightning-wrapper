# Ride the Lightning (RTL)

## Dependencies

RTL requires Lightning Network Daemon (LND) or Core Lightning (CLN) to function. By default, RTL will connect to the chosen lightning node running on your Embassy.

## Usage Instructions

1. Configure and start the service.
2. Click the Launch UI button (you can also find both the Tor and LAN URLs in the "Interfaces" section).
3. Insert your password. You can find your password in `Properties`. Your password can be changed in `Config`. If you change the password through the RTL website, the change will be undone the next time you start the service.

RTL is best experienced on a desktop or laptop computer.

For more detailed instructions on how to use RTL and the Lightning Network, see the official RTL [documentation](https://github.com/Ride-The-Lightning/RTL).
